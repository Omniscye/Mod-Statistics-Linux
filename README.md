# Mod Statistics

Written in C#, this provides an easy to clone and easily changeable mod system that support Thunderstore, the Steam Workshop and NexusMods!

Please note you WILL need API keys, I will not guide you to get those. The code only uses these for verification that the endpoints need, I do not collect these.

Please keep the structure the same in the .json's unless you edit the code yourself!
`thunderstore.json`, `steam.json` and `nexusmods.json` is all you need to edit to add/remove mods.
